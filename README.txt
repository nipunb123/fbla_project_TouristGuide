This application was made by Nipun Bhatnagar and Corey Warden from Timberland High School, MO.
This program was made for the FBLA Coding and Programming Competition and is designed to help find tourist attractions in Missouri.
This program was made in Python and then converted to an executable file using pyinstaller.
Since the program was created and converted on a Windows 10, 64 bit computer, it will only work on such computers.
The main executable file, TouristGuide.exe, is located in the main folder.

*Please see documentation.txt for prerequisite libraries and modules for the program*
