Welcome, here we will show the functionality of our code and how to troubleshoot if you run into an error.

Although the game should automatically run without errors, if you are prompted with errors, try installing these:
Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, and make sure to check/click pyinstaller in the setup application.
Install tkinter using "pip install tk"
Install PIL using "pip install Pillow"
Install bs4 using "pip install beautifulsoup4"
Install requests using "pip install requests"

Also make sure to download all the image files and all the python files.
Make sure all the files are located in the same folder.

Functionality:
	Page 1
	-When the executable file is run, the user is greeted with an entry bar, a submit button, and an exit button.
	-The user is prompted to enter a location, then when ready, they can hit the submit button to move on to the next page.
	-The page will not advance if the user leaves the entry bar blank or tries to submit "Enter City".
	-The user can only enter a location in Missouri and must spell the city correctly. 
	-If the program does not detect a city in Missouri, or the program can not find sufficient attractions for the location, the program won't progress to the next page.
	-The user can exit at any time by clicking the exit button.
	-The user can hit the escape key at any time in order to exit fullscreen mode.

	Page 2
	-The user is greeted with a drop down menu with options for the type of attraction they are looking for at that location
	-The user is prompted to select their preferred type of attraction.
	-The user can select one option and then hit the submit button.
	-If the user tries to submit before selecting an option, nothing will happen.
	-The user can exit at any time by clicking the exit button.
	-The user can hit the escape key at any time in order to exit fullscreen mode.

	Page 3
	-The program provides the user with a list of attractions in the location they selected.
	-All attractions are within a 25 mile radius of the location they selected.
	-The user can exit at any time by clicking the exit button.
	-The user can hit the escape key at any time in order to exit fullscreen mode.

How does it work?
	Our program uses a web scraping tool called Beautiful Soup in order to scrape data from websites to provide the user with attractions near them and the type of attraction.
